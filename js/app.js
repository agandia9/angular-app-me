// So far this is our typical workflow when making an AngularJS app:
// Create a module, and use ng-app in the view to define the application scope.
// Create a controller, and use ng-controller in the view to define the controller scope.
// Add data to $scope in the controller so they can be displayed with expressions in the view.
angular.module("myApp", []);
